We try to parallelize the live-config scripts as much as possible.

Unfortunately, debconf is a choke point where everything needs to be done
sequentially. Therefore we modified the original live-config scripts so that
they are now systemd units that can be executed in parallel but the scripts
only write their debconf values into separate files. These files are then read
by the lernstick-debconf-set-selections service and written to the debconf
database in sequential order.

Scripts that previously executed more debconf specific commands after writing
to the debconf database have been split into -pre and -post parts. While the
-pre variants can be executed in parallel, the -post parts need to be in a
certain order.

All -post units have to be executed after lernstick-debconf-set-selections and
before lernstick-debconf-cleanup.

Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to tell systemd "Execute this group of
service files in a sequential order" without manually hard-coding the ordering
relation in each and every service file. So this is what we do here. We are
using "Before" statements. The ordering of our -post parts is as follows:

1) lernstick-user-setup-post (Before=lernstick-xserver-xorg-post.service)
2) lernstick-xserver-xorg-post
